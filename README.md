# PicoCTF-2023
This repository contains my writeups for some of the problems I have solved in the 2023 PicoCTF competition. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on discord. My Tag is `Hyperion#3326`

## What is PicoCTF?
PicoCTF is an annual cybersecurity competition held by professionals from Carnegie Mellon University which challenges competitorsâ€™ problem solving skills with various tasks with the objective to obtain a flag to get points. Each task has a slight description, followed with an instance button or a file. With the goal in mind of getting the flag, the competitor must exploit computer related vulnerabilities to extract the flag even though it may seem impossible at first in some cases.
