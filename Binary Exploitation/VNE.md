## Background ##
PicoCTF is an annual cybersecurity competition held by professionals from Carnegie Mellon University which challenges competitorsâ€™ problem solving skills with various tasks which have the objective to obtain a flag to get points. Each task has a slight description, followed with an instance button or a file. With the goal in mind of getting the flag, the competitor must exploit computer related vulnerabilities to extract the flag even though it may seem impossible at first.
